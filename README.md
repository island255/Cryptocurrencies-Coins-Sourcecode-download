# Cryptocurrencies-Coins-Sourcecode-download

This is the code to get the latest version of all existing cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap.com. To access the historical snapshots, please go to https://github.com/island255/GetHistoryofCoins.

A snapshot of altcoins on 28 September 2018 can be assessd from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hv_n_XCdpWD7VFQyK22RtctdqO07C0pK.

We use bs4 to crwal GitHub links of altcoins from wesite CoinMarketCap and repo links from GitHub. However, it doesn't alaways work when the website changes its codes. We recommend to use API of CoinMarketCap and GitHub to get a stable access.
